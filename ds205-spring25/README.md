# Abstract: Mapping the Impact: Graph Databases and the Complexities of Trump's Tariffs on Trade

This research explores the application of graph databases, specifically Neo4j, as a robust solution for visualizing and analyzing the intricate trade networks and complex shifts in economic relationships resulting from the implementation of tariffs,. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to represent the interconnectedness and disruptions—such as altered trade routes, elevated costs, and shifting trading blocs—that tariffs induce. By structuring the global trade system where nodes represent entities like countries or commodities, and edges symbolize relationships including trade volumes and tariff rates, the analysis, which utilized data from the UN Comtrade database, was able to leverage powerful Graph Data Science (GDS) algorithms. Centrality algorithms, including PageRank and Betweenness Centrality, were used to identify globally influential trade actors and key transshipment hubs,,, while community detection (Louvain Modularity) and shortest path algorithms (Yen's Algorithm) helped explore how tariffs might influence the formation of trade blocs or redirect goods through alternative, costlier routes,. Case studies, such as the impact of steel tariffs revealing indirect pathways for Canadian steel into the U.S., and the analysis of polypropylene trade demonstrating how tariffs on key nations could raise automotive prices, highlight the effectiveness of graph databases in providing clear visual insights and uncovering strategic roles and vulnerabilities in international trade,,.
