# Abstract: Harmonizing Health: Which Music Genres Affect Mood the Most?

This research project aims to investigate the impact of different music genres on mood sentiments to inform music therapy practices, addressing the lack of specific guidance on genre selection for optimizing therapeutic benefits. The core research question is: How do different genres of music affect mood (measured on scores of happiness, anger, sadness, stress) when compared to a baseline of no music?. The study employs a controlled experiment where participants complete a mildly stress-inducing cognitive task (the Stroop test) while assigned to one of four groups: classical music, jazz, electronic dance music (EDM), or a control group with no music. Mood will be assessed subjectively using 5-point Likert scale surveys (pre- and post-intervention) and objectively through physiological measures, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and cortisol levels. The alternate hypothesis anticipates that music genres will have variations of measurable physiological and emotional effects compared to no music. Expected outcomes, consistent with existing literature, suggest that classical music will significantly reduce tension and anxiety, while EDM may slightly increase anxiety. This research intends to provide music therapists with evidence-based recommendations to personalize interventions and optimize therapeutic outcomes for mental health.
